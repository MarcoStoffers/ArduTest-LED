# ArduTest-LED

Based on an idea of https://jaycar.com.au

## An Arduino based LED Tester with LCD

Select the current and the destination voltage (your battery), connect the LED to the tester and get the needed value for a serial connected Resistor. You can also see the measured values for the LED (forward voltage and current).

To dimm the LED, you can lower the current during measurement down to 3mA or up to 40mA. The Tester always starts with a default current of 10mA!
